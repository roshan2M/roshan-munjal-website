# roshan-munjal-website

This is the first personal website that I've made! I've been putting this project off for a while, but since school ended, I thought it would be really cool to make one.

This website currently uses HTML5 and CSS3 formatting to make it look relatively nice. It is by no means a final website. I will make revisions to this website on regular intervals, improving it and adding features as necessary. I have used a responsive design so that it looks good on (most) devices.

In future revisions, I hope to use cool technologies like jQuery and Bootstrap to give a better user experience. Also, I'm thinking about adding a section for a blog if I have the time for it.
